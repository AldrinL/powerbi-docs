# File names and locations for Power BI technical articles
> [!NOTE]
> Most of the content was removed from this article because it's not relevant to Power BI.  Will update as we settle on directory structure.

In our technical content repository, we use a single folder (the **articles** folder) for all articles. There's no folder hierarchy - all articles live in the flat file structure. If you create folders with articles in them, your articles can't be published.

Instead of using a file structure as an organizing principle, we use a strict file naming convention that clearly identifies topics and that contributes towards discoverability on the web.

## Rules
* No spaces or punctuation characters. Use hyphens to separate the words in the file name.
* Use all lowercase letters
* No more than 80 characters - this is a publishing system limit
* Use action verbs that are specific such as develop, buy, build, troubleshoot. No -ing words.
* No small words - don't include a, and, the, in, or, etc.
* All files must be in markdown and use the .md file extension.
