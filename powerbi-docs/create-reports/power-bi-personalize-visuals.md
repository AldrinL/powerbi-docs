# Let users personalize visuals in a report

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-desktop](../includes/yes-desktop.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-service](../includes/yes-service.md)]

When you share a report with a broad audience, some of your users may want to see slightly different views of particular visuals. Maybe they'd want to swap what's on the axis, change the visual type, or add something to the tooltip. It's hard to make one visual that satisfies everyone's requirements. With this new capability, you can empower your consumers to explore and personalize visuals, all in report reading view. They can adjust the visual the way they want, and save it as a bookmark to come back to. They don't need to have edit permission for the report, or to go back to the report author for a change.

## What report consumers can change

This feature allows consumers to gain further insights through ad-hoc exploration of visuals on a Power BI report. The feature is ideal for report creators who want enable basic exploration scenarios their report readers. Here are modifications that report readers can make:

- Clear out their recent changes

You may have to restart Power BI Desktop to see it in the settings for the current file.

## Enable personalization in a report

After you turn on the preview switch, you need to specifically enable it for the reports that you want consumers to be able to personalize visuals for.

You can enable the feature either in Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service.

### In Power BI Desktop

To enable the feature in Power BI Desktop, go to **File** > **Options and Settings** > **Options** > **Current file** > **Report settings**. Make sure **Personalize visuals (preview)** is turned on.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-personalize-visuals/power-bi-report-settings-personalize-visual.png" alt-text="Enable personalization in a report":::

### In the Power BI service

To enable the feature in the Power BI service instead, go to **Settings** for your report.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-personalize-visuals/power-bi-report-service-settings-personalize-visual.png" alt-text="Report settings in the Power BI service":::

## Select visuals that can be personalized

## Personalize visuals in the Power BI service

By personalizing a visual, your consumers can explore your data in many ways, without leaving report reading view. The following examples show different ways users can modify a visualization to meet their needs. 

1. Open a report in reading view in the Power BI service.

2. In the upper-right corner of the visual, select the **Personalize this visual** ![Personalize this visual icon](media/power-bi-personalize-visuals/power-bi-personalize-visual-icon.png) icon. 

### Change the visualization type

You can view the visualization to a different representation by changing the **Visualization type**.

### Swap out a measure or dimension
You can replace a measure or dimension on the X axis by selecting the field that you want to replace, then selecting another measure or dimension.

### Add or remove a legend
By adding a legend, you can color-code a visual based on a category. You can eliminate the categorical color-coding by clearing the **Legend** box in the **Personalize** pane.

## Limitations and known issues

Currently the feature has a few limitations to be aware of.

- This feature isn't supported for embed scenarios, including publish to web.
- User explorations don't automatically persist. You need to save your view as a personal bookmark to capture your changes.
- You can't change visuals while in the Power BI mobile apps. However, any visual changes you save in a personal bookmark while in the Power BI service are respected in the mobile apps.

There are also some known issues that we're addressing:

- Adding hierarchy isn't supported; you need to add the individual child items.
- You can't change a date hierarchy to a date or vice-versa. 
- With personal bookmarks, you might get results that are slightly different based on the sequence you select. Discrepancies are possible because we don't capture the full state of the report, but just the modifications made. The workaround is to select **Reset to default**, then select the bookmark you want to view. 

## Next steps
