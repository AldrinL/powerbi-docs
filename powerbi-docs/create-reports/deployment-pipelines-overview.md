# Introduction to deployment pipelines (preview)

In todayâ€™s world, analytics is a vital part of decision making in almost every organization. The growing use of Power BI as an analytics tool, requires it to use more data, look appealing and  be user-friendly. Above all however, Power BI needs to always be available and reliable. To meet these requirements, BI creators must collaborate effectively.

The deployment pipelines tool enables BI creators to manage the lifecycle of organizational content. The tool is efficient and reusable for creators in an enterprise with Premium capacity. The tool enables creators to develop and test Power BI content before the content is consumed by users. The content types include reports, dashboards, and datasets.

The tool is designed as a pipeline with three stages:

* **<a name="development"></a>Development**
    
    This stage is used to design, build, and upload new content with  fellow creators. This is the first stage in deployment pipelines.

* **<a name="test"></a>Test**

    You are ready to enter the test stage after you have made all the changes to your content. You upload the modified content so it can be moved to this test stage. Here are three examples of what can be done in the test environment:

    * Share content with testers and reviewers

    * Load and run tests with larger volumes of data

    * Test your app to see how it will look for your end users

* **<a name="production"></a>Production**

    After testing the content, use the production stage to share the final version of your content with business users across the organization.
