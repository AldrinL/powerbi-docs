# Create reports quickly in the Power BI service 

There's a new way to quickly create reports in the Power BI service. Instead of downloading the Power BI Desktop app and importing the data, you can paste data straight into Power BI on the web, and Power BI will automatically generate visuals for you.  

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/quick-create.gif" alt-text="Use Power B I Quick Create to create a report quickly.":::

In the navigation pane in the Power BI service, you can select the **Create** button that opens a page where you can select your data source. It's also accessible from the Create button on Home.

Currently, we only support creating a report based on an existing dataset, or typing or pasting data directly in a table. Over time you'll see other sources, such as uploading an Excel file.  

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/create-source-options.png" alt-text="Add data to create a report, source options.":::

When you choose to type or paste data, you get a grid which you can start to type into. You can also paste data by using Ctrl + V or the context menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/create-enter-data-window.png" alt-text="Type or paste in the Enter Data window.":::

You can use the context menu add and remove columns. If your pasted data includes a header row, select **Use first row as headers** to automatically promote the first row to the header row. Power BI automatically detects the data types, but you have the option to set them manually. Select the **Data type** button next to the column name. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/change-data-type.png" alt-text="Change the data type of the column."::: 

As you go through the creation process, Power BI creates a new dataset for you, and autogenerates a summarized view of your data. These autogenerated visuals propel you from raw data to insights faster than ever.  

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/autogenerated-report.png" alt-text="Power BI creates visuals based on your data automatically.":::

Changing the data you see in the report is easy, too. Use the **Summarize** pane to add or remove fields from the report. Select and unselect fields to update what you want to measure and analyze. Power BI automatically adds or removes charts to show the new combinations.  

Currently you can see a maximum of three measures, shown as rows within the report, and four categories, shown as columns within the report. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/summarize-pane.png" alt-text="Change the way Power B I summarizes the data in the Summarize pane.":::

To see a field summarized in a different way, use the context menu of the field in the **Summarize** pane to switch between sum, average, maximum, minimum, and so on. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/summarize-options.png" alt-text="Switch between sum, average, maximum, minimum, and so on.":::

You can save this report to the workspace you were in when you first selected **Create**. From there, you can share it, just like any other report. The next time you or anyone with edit permissions opens the report, you land right back in this quick edit experience.  

If you want to switch to a full edit experience, select the **Edit** button in the menu bar. Be aware though, that once you save the report in the full edit experience, you can't go back to the quick edit view.  

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/edit-entry-point.png" alt-text="Select the Edit button in the menu bar.":::

This experience should make it easier to create reports on your data and unlock the power of report building to a whole new set of users. Try the new Create experience today.
