# Add multiple fields to a slicer (preview)

If you want to filter across multiple related fields within a single slicer, you can do so by building what's called a *hierarchy* slicer.

To turn on this preview feature, on the **File** menu > **Options and settings** > **Options**. Under **Global**, go to the **Preview features** section and make sure **Hierarchy slicer** is checked.

When you add multiple fields to the slicer, it displays an arrow, or *chevron* next to the items that can be expanded to show the items in the next level.

The behavior of the slicer hasn't changed. You can still swap between a list and dropdown, and you can also style your slicer how you want.

You can set it to single-select mode. You see a semi-selected circle for items that have some children selected.
