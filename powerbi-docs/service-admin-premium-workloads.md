# Configure workloads in a Premium capacity

This article describes enabling and configuring workloads for Power BI Premium capacities. By default, capacities support only the workload associated with running Power BI queries. You can also enable and configure additional workloads for **[AI (Cognitive Services)](service-cognitive-services.md)**, **[Dataflows](service-dataflows-overview.md#dataflow-capabilities-on-power-bi-premium)**, and **[Paginated reports](paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service.md)**.

## Default memory settings

Query workloads are optimized for and limited by resources determined by your Premium capacity SKU. Premium capacities also support additional workloads that can use your capacity's resources. Default memory values for these workloads are based on the capacity nodes available for your SKU. Max memory settings are not cumulative. Memory up to the max value specified is dynamically allocated for AI and dataflows, but is statically allocated for paginated reports.

## Workload settings

### AI (Preview)

In addition to the **Max Memory** setting, the AI workload has an additional setting, **Allow usage from Power BI Desktop**. The default is **Off**. This setting is reserved for future use and may not appear in all tenants.

### Datasets (Preview)

By default, the Datasets workload is enabled and cannot be disabled. This workload contains an additional setting for the _XMLA endpoint_ and a set of performance-related settings. This **XMLA Endpoint** setting specifies that connections from client applications honor the security group membership set at the workspace and app levels. To learn more, see [Connect to datasets with client applications and tools](service-premium-connect-tools.md).

The performance-related settings ae described in the following table.

| Setting Name | Description | Usage |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Max Intermediate Row Set Count** | The max number of intermediate rows returned by DirectQuery. Default value is set to 1000000 and allowable range is between 100000 and 2147483647 | Control the impact of resource-intensive or poorly designed reports. |
| **Max Offline Dataset Size (GB)** | Maximum size of the offline dataset in memory. This is the compressed size on disk. Default value is set by SKU and the allowable range is from 0.1 – 10 GB | Prevent report creators from publishing a large dataset that could negatively impact the capacity. |
| **Max Result Row Set Count** | Defines the maximum number of rows returned in a DAX query. Default value is set to -1(no limit) and allowable range is between 100000 and 2147483647 | Control the impact of resource-intensive or poorly designed reports. |
| **Query Memory Limit (%)** | Applies only to DAX measures and queries. Specified in % and limits how much memory can be used by temporary results during a query. | Control the impact of resource-intensive or poorly designed reports. |
| **Query Timeout (seconds)** | An integer that defines the timeout, in seconds, for queries. The default is 3600 seconds (or 60   minutes). Zero (0) specifies that no queries will timeout. | Maintain better control of long-running queries. |
|  |  |  |

### Dataflows

In addition to the **Max Memory** setting, the Dataflows workload has an additional setting, **Container size**. This setting enables you to optimize dataflow workload performance for processing more complex, compute-heavy dataflows.

When refreshing a dataflow, the dataflow workload spawns a container for each entity in the dataflow. Each container can take memory up to the volume in specified in the Container size setting. The default for all SKUs is **700 MB**. You might want to change this setting if:

- Dataflows take too long to refresh, or dataflow refresh fails on a timeout.
- Dataflow entities include computation steps, for example, a join.  

It's recommend you use the [Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics](service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity.md) app to analyze Dataflow workload performance. 

In some cases, increasing container size may not improve performance. For example, if the dataflow is getting data only from a source without performing significant calculations, changing container size probably won’t help. Increasing container size might help if it will enable the Dataflow workload to allocate more memory for entity refresh operations. By having more memory allocated, it can reduce the time it takes to refresh heavily computed entities.

The Container Size value can’t exceed the maximum memory for the Dataflows workload. For example, a P1 capacity has 25GB of memory. If the Dataflow workload Max Memory (%) is set to 20%, Container Size (MB) cannot exceed 5000. In all cases, the Container Size cannot exceed the Max Memory, even if you set a higher value.

### Paginated reports (Preview)

Paginated reports allow custom code to be run when rendering a report. For example, dynamically changing text color based on content, which can take additional memory. Power BI Premium runs paginated reports in a contained space within the capacity. The Max Memory specified is used *whether or not* the workload is active. If changing the Max Memory setting from default, make sure you set it low enough that it doesn't negatively affect other workloads.

In some cases, the Paginated Reports workload can become unavailable. In this case, the workload shows an error state in the Admin portal, and users see timeouts for report rendering. To mitigate this issue, disable the workload and then enable it again.

## Configure workloads

Maximize your capacity's available resources by enabling workloads only if they will be used. Change memory and other settings only when you have determined default settings are not meeting your capacity resource requirements.

### To configure workloads in the Power BI admin portal

1. In **Capacity settings** > **PREMIUM CAPACITIES**, select a capacity.

1. Under **MORE OPTIONS**, expand **Workloads**.

1. Enable one or more workloads, and set a value for **Max Memory** and other settings.

1. Select **Apply**.

### REST API

Workloads can be enabled and assigned to a capacity by using the [Capacities](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/capacities) REST APIs.

## Monitoring workloads

The [Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app](service-admin-premium-monitor-capacity.md) provides dataset, dataflows, and paginated reports metrics to monitor workloads enabled for your capacities.
