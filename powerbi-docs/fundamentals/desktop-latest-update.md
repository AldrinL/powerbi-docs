If you're running Windows 10, you can also get Power BI Desktop from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore). Regardless of how you install Power BI Desktop, the monthly versions are the same, although the version numbering may differ. For more information about downloading and installing Power BI Desktop, see [Get Power BI Desktop](desktop-get-the-desktop.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power BI Desktop is updated and released on a monthly basis, incorporating customer feedback and new features. Only the most recent version of Power BI Desktop is supported; customers who contact support for Power BI Desktop will be asked to upgrade to the most recent version.
