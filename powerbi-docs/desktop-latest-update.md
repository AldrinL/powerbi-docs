# What's new in the latest Power BI Desktop update? 


## November 2019 Update (2.75.5649.341)

We're excited about our November updates, which are as welcome as a happy family gathering. 

You can now [download the latest version of Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop), now delivered as a single .exe file that contains all supported languages. If you're running Windows 10, you can also get **Power BI Desktop** from the Windows Store. The monthly versions are the same even though the version numbering may differ between the two, regardless of which way you install **Power BI Desktop**. See [this article](desktop-get-the-desktop.md) for more information. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Beginning with the September 2019 release, Power BI Desktop is only released as a single .exe file that contains all supported languages. The .msi version is no longer being released.
