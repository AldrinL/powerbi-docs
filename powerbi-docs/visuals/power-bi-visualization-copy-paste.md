# Copy and paste a visualization in a report

Visuals in Power BI can be copied from one page in the report to the same page or a different page in the same report. 

Copying and pasting a visualization requires edit permissions to the report. In the Power BI service, this means opening the report in [Editing View](../consumer/end-user-reading-view.md).

## Copy and paste a visual

1. Open a report that has at least one visualization.  

2. Select the visualization and use **Ctrl+C** to copy, and **Ctrl+V** to paste.
