# Troubleshooting Power BI Gateway - Personal

[!INCLUDE [gateway-rewrite](includes/gateway-rewrite.md)]

The following sections go through some common issues you may come across when using the Power BI Gateway - Personal.

## Update to the latest version

The current version of the gateway for personal use is the **On-premises data gateway (personal)**. Please update your installation to use that version.

Many issues can surface when the gateway version is out of date.  It's a good general practice to make sure you're on the latest version. If you haven't updated the gateway for a month, or longer, consider installing the latest version of the gateway. Then, see if you can reproduce the issue.

## Installation
**Personal gateway is 64 bit** - If your machine is 32-bit, you can't install the personal gateway. Your operating system has to be 64-bit version. Install a 64-bit version of Windows or install the personal gateway on a 64-bit machine.

**Personal gateway fails to install as a service even though you are a local administrator for the computer** - Installation can fail if the user is in the computer’s local Administrator group, but group policy doesn't allow that username to sign in as a service. At the moment, ensure the group policy lets a user sign in as a service. We’re working on a fix for this issue. [Learn more](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc739424.aspx)

**Operation timed out** - This message is common if the computer (physical machine or VM) on which you’re installing the personal gateway has a single core processor. Close any applications and turn off any non-essential processes and try installing again.

**Data Management Gateway or Analysis Services Connector can't be installed on the same computer as personal gateway** - If you already have an Analysis Services Connector or Data Management Gateway installed, you must first uninstall the Connector or the gateway. Then, try installing the personal gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter an issue during installation, the setup logs can provide information to help you resolve the issue. For more information, see [Setup Logs](#SetupLogs).
> 
> 

 **Proxy configuration**
 You may see issues with configuring the personal gateway if your environment needs the use of a proxy. To learn more about how to configure proxy information, see [Configuring proxy settings for the on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-proxy).

## Schedule refresh
**Error: The credential stored in the cloud is missing.**

You might get this error in Settings for \<dataset\> if you have a scheduled refresh and then uninstalled and reinstalled the personal gateway. When you uninstall a personal gateway, the data source credentials for a dataset that's been configured for refresh are removed from the Power BI service.

**Solution:** In Power BI, go to the refresh settings for a dataset. In Manage Data Sources, for any data source with an error, select **Edit credentials** and sign in to the data source again.

**Error: The credentials provided for the dataset are invalid. Please update the credentials through a refresh or in the Data Source Settings dialog to continue.**

**Solution**: If you get a credentials message, it could mean:

* Make sure usernames and passwords for signing into data sources are up-to-date. In Power BI, go to refresh settings for the dataset. In Manage Data Sources, select **Edit credentials** to update the credentials for the data source.
* Mashups between a cloud source and an on-premises source, in a single query, fail to refresh in the personal gateway if one of the sources is using OAuth for authentication. An example of this issue is a mashup between CRM Online and a local SQL Server. The mashup fails because CRM Online requires OAuth.
  
  This error is a known issue and it's being looked at. To work around the problem, have a separate query for the cloud source and the on-premises source. Then, use a merge or append query to combine them.

**Error: Unsupported data source.**

**Solution:** If you get an unsupported data source message in Schedule Refresh settings, it could mean: 

* The data source isn't currently supported for refresh in Power BI. 
* The Excel workbook doesn't contain a data model, only worksheet data. Power BI currently only supports refresh if the uploaded Excel workbook contains a data model. When you import data using Power Query in Excel, be sure to choose the option to Load data to data model. This option ensures data is imported into a data model. 

**Error: [Unable to combine data] &lt;query part&gt;/&lt;…&gt;/&lt;…&gt; is accessing data sources that have privacy levels, which cannot be used together. Please rebuild this data combination.**

**Solution**: This error is because of the privacy level restrictions and the types of data sources you're using.

**Error: Data source error: We cannot convert the value "\[Table\]" to type Table.**

**Solution**: This error is because of the privacy level restrictions and the types of data sources you're using.

**Error: There is not enough space for this row.**

This error occurs if you have a single row greater than 4 MB in size. Find the row from your data source and attempt to filter it out or reduce the size for that row.

## Data sources
**Missing data provider** – The personal gateway is 64-bit version only. It requires a 64-bit version of the data providers to be installed on the same computer where the personal gateway is installed. For example, if the data source in the dataset is Microsoft Access, you must install the 64-bit ACE provider on the same computer where you installed the personal gateway.  

>[!NOTE]
>If you have 32-bit version Excel, you can't install a 64-bit version ACE provider on the same computer.

**Windows authentication is not supported for Access database** - Power BI currently only supports anonymous for Access database. We're working on enabling Windows authentication for Access database.

**Sign in error when entering credentials for a datasource** - If you get an error like this one when entering Windows credentials for a data source, you might still be on an older version of the personal gateway. [Install the latest version of Power BI Gateway - Personal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/gateway/).

**Error: Sign in error when selecting Windows authentication for a data source using ACE OLEDB** - If you get the following error when entering data source credentials for a data source using ACE OLEDB provider:

![](media/service-admin-troubleshooting-power-bi-personal-gateway/aceoledberror.png)

Power BI doesn't currently support Windows authentication for a data source using ACE OLEDB provider.

**Solution:** To work around this error, you can select **Anonymous authentication**. For legacy ACE OLEDB provider, Anonymous credentials are equal to Windows credentials.

## Tile refresh
If you're receiving an error with dashboard tiles refreshing, refer to the following article.

[Troubleshooting tile errors](refresh-troubleshooting-tile-errors.md)

## Tools for troubleshooting
### Refresh History
**Refresh History** helps you see what errors have occurred and provides useful data if you need to create a support request. You can view both scheduled and on demand, refreshes. Here's how you get to the **Refresh History**.

1. In the Power BI navigation pane, in **Datasets**, select a dataset &gt; Open Menu &gt; **Schedule Refresh**.
   ![](media/service-admin-troubleshooting-power-bi-personal-gateway/scheduled-refresh.png)
1. In **Settings for...**, select **Refresh History**.

### Event logs
Several event logs can provide information. The first two, **Data Management Gateway** and **PowerBIGateway**, are present if you're an admin on the machine.  If you're not an admin, and you're using the Personal Gateway, you'll see the log entries within the **Application** log.

The **Data Management Gateway** and **PowerBIGateway** logs are present under **Application and Services Logs**.

![](media/service-admin-troubleshooting-power-bi-personal-gateway/event-logs.png)

### Fiddler trace
[Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a free tool from Telerik that monitors HTTP traffic. You can see the communication with the Power BI service from the client machine. This communication may show errors and other related information.

### Setup Logs
If the **Personal Gateway**, fails to install, you'll see a link to show the setup log. The setup log can show you details about the failure. These logs are Windows Install logs, also known as MSI logs. They can be fairly complex and hard to read. Typically, the resulting error is at the bottom, but determining the cause of the error isn't trivial. It could be a result of errors in a different log, or be a result of an error higher up in the log.

![](media/service-admin-troubleshooting-power-bi-personal-gateway/setup-log.png)

Or, you can go to your **Temp folder** (%temp%) and look for files that start with **Power\_BI\_**.

> [!NOTE]
> Going to %temp% may take you to a subfolder of temp. The **Power\_BI\_** files are in the root of the temp directory.  You may need to go up a level or two.
