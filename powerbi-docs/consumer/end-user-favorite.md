# Favorite dashboards, reports, and apps in the Power BI service
When you make content a *favorite*,  you'll be able to access it quickly from the **Favorites** content list and from **Power BI Home** > **Favorites and frequents**.  Favorites are typically content that you visit most often and are identified with a yellow star.

You can also select a single dashboard as a [featured dashboard](end-user-featured.md) in the Power BI service.

## Add a dashboard or report as a *favorite*

1. Open a dashboard or report that you use often. Even content that has been shared with you can be a *favorite*.

2. From the upper menu bar of the Power BI service, select **Favorite** or the star ![star icon](./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-favorite-icon.png)  icon.

   You can also favorite a dashboard or report from anywhere you see the star icon, such as Home, Recent, Apps, and Shared with me.

## Add an app as a *favorite*

1. From the navigation pane, select **Apps**.

2. Hover over an app to display more detail.  Select the star ![star icon](./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-favorite-icon.png)  icon to set as a favorite.

## Working with *favorites*
1. To access your favorites, select the flyout arrow to the right of **Favorites**.  From here you can select a favorite to open it. Up to five favorites are listed (alphabetically). If you have more than five, select **See all** to open the favorites content list (see #2, below).

2. To see **all** the content that you have added as favorites, in the navigation pane, select **Favorites** or the Favorites ![star icon](./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-favorites-icon.png)  icon.  
   
    ![favorite window](./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-fav-screen.png)
   
   From here you can take action: open, identify owners, and even share with your colleagues.

## Unfavorite content
No longer use a report as often as you used to?  You can unfavorite it. When you unfavorite content, it is removed from your Favorites list but not from Power BI.

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Favorites** to open the **Favorites** screen.
   
   ![Favorites screen](./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-un-favorite.png)
2. Select the yellow star next to the content to unfavorite.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also unfavorite a dashboard, report, or app itself. Just open and de-select the yellow icon.   
> 
> 
## Limitations and considerations
At the current time, you can favorite an app and this automatically favorites all the reports and dashboards for that app. It is not possible to favorite individual app reports or dashboards.
