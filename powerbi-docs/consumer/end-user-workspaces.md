# Collaborate in workspaces

 *Workspaces* are places to collaborate with colleagues on specific content. Workspaces are created by Power BI *designers* to hold collections of dashboards and reports. The designer can then share the workspace with colleagues and can also bundle that collection into an *app* and distribute it to the entire organization, or to specific people or groups. 

 Everyone using the Power BI service also has a **My workspace**.  My workspace is your personal sandbox where you can create content for yourself.

 You can see your workspaces from Power BI **Home** or by selecting **Workspace** or **My workspace** from your left navigation pane.

## Types of workspaces
**My Workspace** stores all the content that you own and create. Think of it as your personal sandbox or work area for your own content. For many Power BI *consumers*, **My workspace** remains empty because your job doesn't involve creating new content. *Consumers*, by definition, consume data created by others and use that data to make business decisions. If you find that you are creating content, consider reading [the Power BI articles for designers](../create-reports/index.yml) instead.

**Workspaces** contain all the content for a specific app. When a *designer* creates an app, they bundle together all the content that is necessary for that app to be utilized. Content may include dashboards, reports, and datasets. Not every app will contain these three pieces of content. An app may contain only one dashboard, or three of each content type, or even twenty reports. It all depends on what the *designer* includes in the app. Commonly, app workspaces for *consumers* won't include the datasets.

The Fig sales workspace below contains three reports and one dashboard.

## Roles in the workspaces

Roles determine what you can do in a workspace, so teams can collaborate.  When granting access to a new workspace, *designers* add individuals or groups to one of the workspace roles: **Viewer**, **Member**, **Contributor**, or **Admin**. 


As a Power BI *consumer*, you'll typically interact in workspaces using the **Viewer** role. But a *designer* could also assign you to the **Member** or **Contributor** role. The Viewer role lets you view and interact with content (dashboards, reports, apps) created by others and shared with you. And because the Viewer role can't access the underlying dataset, it's a safe way to interact with content and not have to worry that you'll "hurt" the underlying data.


For a detailed list of what you can do as a *consumer* with the Viewer role, see [Power BI features for consumers](end-user-features.md).


### Workspace roles

Here are the capabilities of the four roles: Admins, Members, Contributors, and Viewers. All of these capabilities, except viewing and interacting, require a Power BI Pro license.

## Licensing, workspaces, and capacity
Licensing also plays a part in determining what you can and can't do in a workspace. Many features require the user to have a Power BI *Pro* license. Most *consumers* work with a *free* license. 

If you have a free license and the workspace is stored in *Premium capacity*, you'll be able to view and interact with the content in that workspace. A diamond icon identifies workspaces and apps that are stored in Premium capacity.
