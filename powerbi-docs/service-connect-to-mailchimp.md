# Connect to MailChimp with Power BI
This article walks you through pulling your data from your MailChimp account with a Power BI template app. The template app generates a workspace with a dashboard, a set of reports, and a dataset to allow you to explore your MailChimp data. Pull in analytics to create [MailChimp dashboards](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/integrations/mailchimp) and quickly identify trends within your campaigns, reports, and individual subscribers. The data refreshes daily, ensuring the data you're monitoring is up to date.

After you've installed the template app, you can change the dashboard and report. Then you can distribute it as an app to colleagues in your organization.

## Modify and distribute your app

You've installed the MailChimp template app. That means you've also created the MailChimp app workspace. In the workspace, you can change the report and dashboard, and then distribute it as an *app* to colleagues in your organization. 

1. To view all the contents of your new MailChimp workspace, in the left navigation bar, select **Workspaces** > **MailChimp**.

    This view is the content list for the workspace. In the upper-right corner, you see **Update app**. When you're ready to distribute your app to your colleagues, that's where you'll start.
