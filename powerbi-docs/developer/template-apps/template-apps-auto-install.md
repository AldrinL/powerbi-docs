# Automatically install and configure template apps for your customers

As an independent software vendor (ISV) or developer, you can create an application that can seamlessly install, configure, update, and refresh a template app on a customer's tenant when they click a link on your website or portal. This article shows how to create such an application using the Power BI APIs.

In this article, you learn how to:

### Automated installation flow
![Diagram of automated template app install flow.](media/template-apps-auto-install/template-apps-automated-install.png)

[Talk the developer through the above diagram via a narrative description]

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must have:

* A [Power BI Pro account](../../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md) (a master account that is a username and password to sign in to your Power BI Pro account), or a [service principal (app-only token)](embed-service-principal.md).
* You need to have your own [Azure Active Directory tenant](create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant.md) setup.
* A parameterized template app that is ready to be installed by Power BI users. This template app should be available on AppSource or through a preproduction link. The template app should be created in the same tenant in which you register your application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This is necessary so that [Explain why]

    See [template app tips](../../connect-data/service-template-apps-tips.md) or [the deep dive into query parameter and Power BI templates](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deep-dive-into-query-parameters-and-power-bi-templates/) for more information.


If you're not signed up for **Power BI Pro**, [sign up for a free trial](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/) before you begin.

## Set up your template apps automation development environment

Before you create your application, you need to make sure your environment allows for embedding with Power BI.

You can go through the [Embedding setup tool](https://aka.ms/embedsetup/AppOwnsData), so you can quickly get started and download a sample application that helps you walk through creating an environment and embedding a report.

However, if you choose to set up the environment manually, you can continue below.

### Register an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

[Register your application](register-app.md) with Azure Active Directory to allow your application access to the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/). Registering your application allows you to establish an identity for your application and specify [permissions to Power BI REST resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent). Depending if you want to use a master account or [service principal](embed-service-principal.md), determines how to get started registering an application.

Depending on which method you take, affects which type of application you register in Azure.

If you proceed using a master account, then proceed with registering a **Native** app. You use a Native app because you're working with a non-interactive login.

However, if you proceed using the service principal, you need to proceed with registering a **server-side web application** app. You register a server-side web application to create an application secret.

## Set up your Power BI environment

### Create a workspace

If you're embedding reports, dashboards, or tiles for your customers, then you have to place your content within a workspace. There are different types of workspaces that you can set up: the [traditional workspaces](../../collaborate-share/service-create-workspaces.md) or the [new workspaces](../../collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces.md). If you're using a *master* account, then it doesn't matter which type of workspaces you use. However, if you use *[service principal](embed-service-principal.md)* to sign into your application, then you're required to use the new workspaces. In either scenario, both the *master* account or *service principal* must be an admin of the workspaces involved with your application.

### Create and publish your reports

You can create your reports and datasets using Power BI Desktop and then publish those reports to a workspace. There are two ways to accomplish this task: As an end user, you can publish reports to a traditional workspace with a master account (Power BI Pro license). If you're using service principal, you can publish reports to the new workspaces using the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/imports/postimportingroup).

The below steps walk through how to publish your PBIX report to your Power BI workspace.

1. Download the sample [Blog Demo](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples) from GitHub.

    ![report sample](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-026-1.png)

2. Open sample PBIX report in **Power BI Desktop**.

   ![PBI desktop report](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-027.png)

3. Publish to **workspaces**. This process differs depending on whether you're using a master account (Power Pro license), or service principal. If you're using a master account, then you can publish your report through Power BI Desktop.  Now if you're using service principal, you must use the Power BI REST APIs.

============= Ran ========================

## Install and configure your app using our Azure Function sample

This sample is deliberately kept simple for demonstration purposes. This sample project allows you to leverage [Azure Function]() and [Azure App Configuration]() to easily deploy and use the automated install API for you apps.

1. Download [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (version 2017 or later). Make sure to download the latest [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/powerbi).

2. Follow the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) to develop an Azure Function along with Azure App Configuration.

3. Download the [Automated Install Azure Function sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Template-apps-examples/tree/master/Developer%20Samples/Automated%20Install%20Azure%20Function) from GitHub to get started.

    ![Automated Install Azure Function sample](media/template-apps-auto-install/azure-function-sample.png)

4. To run this sample, you would need to setup your Azure App Configuration with the values & keys as described below. Keys are also defined in **Constants.cs**.

    <center>

    | Configuration Key | Meaning           |
    |---------------    |-------------------|
    | TemplateAppInstall:Application:AppId | *AppId* from [install URL](#Template-App-Preparation) |
    | TemplateAppInstall:Application:PackageKey | *PackageKey* from [install URL](#Template-App-Preparation) |
    | TemplateAppInstall:Application:OwnerId | *OwnerId* from [install URL](#Template-App-Preparation) |
    | TemplateAppInstall:ServicePrincipal:ClientId | Service Principal [Application ID](#Application-ID) |
    | TemplateAppInstall:ServicePrincipal:ClientSecret | Service Principal [Application secret](#Application-secret) |

    </center>

    ![Constant.cs file](media/template-apps-auto-install/constants-app-configuration.png)

### Template App Properties

Fill in all relevant Template app properties as they are defined when the app is created. These properties are the template app's **AppId**, **PakcageKey** & **OwnerId**.

To get the above values, follow these steps:

1. Sign into [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com).

2. Go to the application's original workspace.

3. Open the Release management pane.

    ![Release Management pane](media/template-apps-auto-install/release-management-001.png)

4. Select the app version and get its install link.

    ![Get link](media/template-apps-auto-install/release-management-002.png)

5. Copy the link to clipboard.

    ![Get link](media/template-apps-auto-install/release-management-003.png)

6. This install URL hold the 3 url parameters whose values you need. Use the **appId**, **packageKey** & **ownerId** values for the application. Sample URL will look like the below.

```https://app.powerbi.com/Redirect?action=InstallApp&appId=3c386...16bf71c67&packageKey=b2df4b...dLpHIUnum2pr6k&ownerId=72f9...1db47&buildVersion=5```

### Application ID

Fill in the **applicationId** information with the **Application ID** from **Azure**. The **applicationId** is used by the application to identify itself to the users from which you're requesting permissions.

To get the **applicationId**, follow these steps:

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the left-hand nav pane, select **All Services**, and select **App Registrations**.

    ![App registration search](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-003.png)

3. Select the application that needs the **applicationId**.

    ![Choosing App](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-006.png)

4. There's an **Application ID** that is listed as a GUID. Use this **Application ID** as the **applicationId** for the application.

    ![applicationId](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-007.png)

### Application secret

Fill in the **ApplicationSecret** information from the **Keys** section of your **App registrations** section in **Azure**.  This attribute works when using [service principal](embed-service-principal.md).

To get the **ApplicationSecret**, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the left-hand nav pane, select **All services** and then select **App registrations**.

    ![App registration search](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-003.png)

3. Select the application that needs to use the **ApplicationSecret**.

    ![Choose an app](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-0038.png)

4. Select **Certificates and secrets** under **Manage**.

5. Select **New client secrets**.

6. Enter a name in the **Description** box and select a duration. Then select **Save** to get the **Value** for your application. When you close the **Keys** pane after saving the key value, the value field shows only as hidden. At that point, you aren't able to retrieve the key value. If you lose the key value, create a new one in the Azure portal.

    ![Key value](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-042.png)

### Test the application
## Test this function locally

Follow the steps as described in [Run the function locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-your-first-function-visual-studio#run-the-function-locally) to start your function.

Configure your portal to issue a ```POST``` request to the url of the function (e.g. ```POST http://localhost:7071/api/install```). Request body should be a JSON object describing Key-Value pairs, where keys are *parameter names* (defined in Power BI Desktop) and values are the desired values to set for each parameter in the template app.

>[!Note]
> Parameter values in production are to be deduced for each user by your portal's intended logic.

The desired flow should be:

1. Portal prepares the request, per user\session.
2. ```POST /api/install``` request issued to Azure Function.
3. If all is configured properly, browser should automatically redirect to Power BI and show automated install flow.
4. Upon installation, parameter values are set as configured in steps 1 & 2.

## Embed content within your application

Even though the steps to embed your content are done with the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/), the example codes described in this article are made with the **.NET SDK**.

Embedding for your customers within your application requires you to get an **access token** for your master account or [service principal](embed-service-principal.md) from **Azure AD**. You're required to get an [Azure AD access token](get-azuread-access-token.md#access-token-for-non-power-bi-users-app-owns-data) for your Power BI application before you make calls to the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/).

To create the Power BI Client with your **access token**, you want to create your Power BI client object, which allows you to interact with the [Power BI REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/). You create the Power BI client object by wrapping the **AccessToken** with a ***Microsoft.Rest.TokenCredentials*** object.

```csharp
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
using Microsoft.Rest;
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2;

var tokenCredentials = new TokenCredentials(authenticationResult.AccessToken, "Bearer");

// Create a Power BI Client object. it's used to call Power BI APIs.
using (var client = new PowerBIClient(new Uri(ApiUrl), tokenCredentials))
{
    // Your code to embed items.
}
```

### Get the content item you want to embed

You can use the Power BI client object to retrieve a reference to the item you want to embed.

Here is a code sample of how to retrieve the first report from a given workspace.

*A sample of getting a content item whether it's a report, dashboard, or tile that you want to embed is available within the Services\EmbedService.cs file in the [sample application](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples).*

```csharp
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2;
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2.Models;

// You need to provide the workspaceId where the dashboard resides.
ODataResponseListReport reports = await client.Reports.GetReportsInGroupAsync(workspaceId);

// Get the first report in the group.
Report report = reports.Value.FirstOrDefault();
```

### Create the embed token
Generate an embed token, which can be used from the JavaScript API. There are two types of APIs, the first group contains five APIs, each generates an embed token for a specific item. The second group, which contains only one API, generates a token that can be used to embed multiple items.

**APIs for generating an embed token for a specific item**

The embed token created with these APIs is specific to the item you're embedding. Any time you embed a Power BI item (such as a report, dashboard, or tile) with these APIs, you need to create a new embed token for it.
* [Dashboards GenerateTokenInGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/embedtoken/dashboards_generatetokeningroup)
* [Datasets GenerateTokenInGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/embedtoken/datasets_generatetokeningroup)
* [Reports GenerateTokenForCreateInGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/embedtoken/reports_generatetokenforcreateingroup)
* [Reports GenerateTokenInGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/embedtoken/reports_generatetokeningroup)
* [Tiles GenerateTokenInGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/embedtoken/tiles_generatetokeningroup)

Samples of creating an embed token for a report, dashboard, or tile, are available from the following files in the [sample application](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples).
* Services\EmbedService.cs
* Models\EmbedConfig.cs
* Models\TileEmbedConfig.cs

Below is a code example for using the reports GenerateTokenInGroup embed token API.
```csharp
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2;
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2.Models;

// Generate Embed Token.
var generateTokenRequestParameters = new GenerateTokenRequest(accessLevel: "view");
EmbedToken tokenResponse = client.Reports.GenerateTokenInGroup(workspaceId, report.Id, generateTokenRequestParameters);

// Generate Embed Configuration.
var embedConfig = new EmbedConfig()
{
    EmbedToken = tokenResponse,
    EmbedUrl = report.EmbedUrl,
    Id = report.Id
};
```

**API for generating an embed token for multiple items**<a id="multiEmbedToken"></a>

The [Generate Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/embedtoken/generatetoken) embed API generates a token that can be used for embedding multiple items.

It can also be used for dynamically selecting a dataset while embedding a report. For more information about this use of the API, see [dynamic binding](embed-dynamic-binding.md).


Below is an example of using this API.
 
```csharp
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2;
using Microsoft.PowerBI.Api.V2.Models;

var reports = new List<GenerateTokenRequestV2Report>()
{ 
    new GenerateTokenRequestV2Report()
    {
        AllowEdit = false,
        Id = report1.Id
    },
    new GenerateTokenRequestV2Report()
    {
        AllowEdit = true,
        Id = report2.Id
    }
};

var datasets= new List<GenerateTokenRequestV2Dataset>()
{
    new GenerateTokenRequestV2Dataset(dataset1.Id),
    new GenerateTokenRequestV2Dataset(dataset2.Id),
    new GenerateTokenRequestV2Dataset(dataset3.Id),
};

var targetWorkspaces = new List<GenerateTokenRequestV2TargetWorkspace>()
{
    new GenerateTokenRequestV2TargetWorkspace(workspace1.Id),
    new GenerateTokenRequestV2TargetWorkspace(workspace2.Id),
};

var request = new GenerateTokenRequestV2()
{
    Datasets = datasetsRequestDetails ?? null,
    Reports = reportsRequestDetails,
    TargetWorkspaces = targetWSRequestdetials ?? null,
};

var token = client.GetClient().EmbedToken.GenerateToken(request);
```

### Load an item using JavaScript

You can use JavaScript to load a report into a div element on your web page.

For a full sample of using the JavaScript API, you can use the [Playground tool](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-JavaScript/demo). The Playground tool is a quick way to play with different types of Power BI Embedded samples. You can also get more Information about the JavaScript API by visiting the [PowerBI-JavaScript wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-javascript/wiki) page.

Here is a sample that uses an **EmbedConfig** model and a **TileEmbedConfig** model along with views for a report.

*A sample of adding a view for a report, dashboard, or tile is available within the Views\Home\EmbedReport.cshtml, Views\Home\EmbedDashboard.cshtml, or Views\Home\Embedtile.cshtml files in the [sample application](#embed-content-using-the-sample-application).*

```javascript
<script src="~/scripts/powerbi.js"></script>
<div id="reportContainer"></div>
<script>
    // Read embed application token from Model
    var accessToken = "@Model.EmbedToken.Token";

    // Read embed URL from Model
    var embedUrl = "@Html.Raw(Model.EmbedUrl)";

    // Read report Id from Model
    var embedReportId = "@Model.Id";

    // Get models. models contains enums that can be used.
    var models = window['powerbi-client'].models;

    // Embed configuration used to describe what and how to embed.
    // This object is used when calling powerbi.embed.
    // This also includes settings and options such as filters.
    // You can find more information at https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript/wiki/Embed-Configuration-Details.
    var config = {
        type: 'report',
        tokenType: models.TokenType.Embed,
        accessToken: accessToken,
        embedUrl: embedUrl,
        id: embedReportId,
        permissions: models.Permissions.All,
        settings: {
            filterPaneEnabled: true,
            navContentPaneEnabled: true
        }
    };

    // Get a reference to the embedded report HTML element
    var reportContainer = $('#reportContainer')[0];

    // Embed the report and display it within the div container.
    var report = powerbi.embed(reportContainer, config);
</script>
```

## Move to production

Now that you've completed developing your application, it's time to back your workspace with a dedicated capacity. 

> [!Important]
> Dedicated capacity is required to move to production. All workspaces (the ones containing the reports or dashboards, and the ones containing the datasets) must be assigned to a capacity.

### Create a dedicated capacity

By creating a dedicated capacity, you can take advantage of having a dedicated resource for your customer. There are two types of capacity you can choose from:
* **Power BI Premium** - A tenant-level Office 356 subscription available in two SKU families, *EM* and *P*. When embedding Power BI content, this solution is referred to as *Power BI embedding*. For more information regarding this subscription, see [What is Power BI Premium?](../../admin/service-premium-what-is.md)
* **Azure Power BI Embedded** - You can purchase a dedicated capacity from the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). This subscription uses the *A* SKUs. For details on how to create a Power BI Embedded capacity, see [Create Power BI Embedded capacity in the Azure portal](azure-pbie-create-capacity.md).
> [!NOTE]
> With A SKUs, you can't access Power BI content with a FREE Power BI license.

The table below describes the resources and limits of each SKU. To determine which capacity best fits your needs, see the [which SKU should I purchase for my scenario](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/embedded-faq#which-solution-should-i-choose) table.

| Capacity Nodes | Total v-cores | Backend v-cores | RAM (GB) | Frontend v-cores | DirectQuery/Live Connection (per sec) | Model Refresh Parallelism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EM1/A1 | 1 | 0.5 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 3.75 | 1 |
| EM2/A2 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 7.5 | 2 |
| EM3/A3 | 4 | 2 | 10 | 2 | 15 | 3 |
| P1/A4 | 8 | 4 | 25 | 4 | 30 | 6 |
| P2/A5 | 16 | 8 | 50 | 8 | 60 | 12 |
| P3/A6 | 32 | 16 | 100 | 16 | 120 | 24 |
| | | | | | | |

### Development testing

For development testing, you can use embed trial tokens with a Pro license. To embed in a production environment, use a dedicated capacity.

The number of embed trial tokens a Power BI service principal or master account can generate is limited. Use the [Available Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/availablefeatures/getavailablefeatures) API to check the percentage of your current embedded usage. The usage amount is displayed per service principal or master account.

If you run out of embed tokens while testing, you need to purchase a Power BI Embedded or Premium [capacity](embedded-capacity.md). There's no limit to the number of embed tokens you can generate with a dedicated capacity.


### Assign a workspace to a dedicated capacity

Once you create a dedicated capacity, you can assign your workspace to that dedicated capacity.

All the workspaces that contain Power BI resources related to the embedded content (including datasets, reports, and dashboards), must be assigned to dedicated capacities. For example, if an embedded report and the dataset bound to it reside in different workspaces, both workspaces must be assigned to dedicated capacities.

To assign a dedicated capacity to a workspace using [service principal](embed-service-principal.md), use the [Power BI REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/capacities/groups_assigntocapacity). When you are using the Power BI REST APIs, make sure to use the [service principal object ID](embed-service-principal.md).

Follow the steps below to assign a dedicated capacity to a workspace using a **master account**.

1. Within the **Power BI service**, expand workspaces and select the ellipsis for the workspace you're using for embedding your content. Then select **Edit workspaces**.

    ![Edit Workspace](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-036.png)

2. Expand **Advanced**, then enable **Dedicated capacity**, then select the dedicated capacity you created. Then select **Save**.

    ![Assign dedicated capacity](media/template-apps-auto-install/embed-sample-for-customers-024.png)

3. After you select **Save**, you should see a **diamond** next to the workspace name.
