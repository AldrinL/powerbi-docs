# Add bookmarks support for Power BI Visuals

Power BI report bookmarks allow capturing configured view of a report page, selection state, filtering state of the visual. But it requires additional action from custom visuals side to support the bookmark and react correctly to changes.

Read more about bookmarks in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/desktop-bookmarks)

## Report bookmarks support in your visual

If your visual interacts with other visuals, selects data points or filters other visuals, you need to restore state from properties.

## How to add report bookmarks support

1. Install (or update) the required util: `powerbi-visuals-utils-interactivityutils`(https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-utils-interactivityutils/) version 3.0.0 or higher. It contains additional classes to manipulate with state selection or filter. It's required for filter visuals, and any visual using the `InteractivityService`.

2. Update visual API to 1.11.0 to use `registerOnSelectCallback` in instance of `SelectionManager`. It's required for non-filter visuals using the plain `SelectionManager` rather than the `InteractivityService`.

### How custom visuals interact with Power BI in the report bookmarks scenario

Let's consider the following example: A user creates several bookmarks in the report page, with a different selection state in each bookmark.

First, the user selects a data point in your visual. The visual interacts with Power BI and other visuals by passing selections to the host. Then the user selects "Add" in `Bookmark panel` and Power BI saves the current selections for the new bookmark.

It happens repeatedly as the user changes selection and adds new bookmarks.
Once created, the user can switch between the bookmarks.

When users select a bookmark, Power BI restores the saved filter or selection state and passes to the visuals. Other visuals will be highlighted or filtered according to the state stored in the bookmark. Power BI host responsible for actions. Your visual is responsible for correctly reflecting the new selection state (for example, change color of rendered data points).

The new selection state is communicated to the visual through the `update` method. The `options` argument will contain a special property: `options.jsonFilters`. It's JSONFilter, property can contain `Advanced Filter`, and `Tuple Filter`.

The visual should restore filter values to displays correspond state of the visual for selected bookmark.

Or, use the special callback function call registered `registerOnSelectCallback` method of ISelectionManager, if the visual use selections only.

### Visuals with selections

If your visuals interact with other visuals by using [selections](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/blob/master/Tutorial/Selection.md). You have two ways to add bookmarks.

* You can use `FilterManager.restoreSelectionIds` method if you **didn't use [`InteractivityService`](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-visuals-utils-interactivityutils/blob/master/docs/api/interactivityService.md)** before in your visual.

* If your visual already uses **[`InteractivityService`](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-visuals-utils-interactivityutils/blob/master/docs/api/interactivityService.md)** to manage selections. You should use `applySelectionFromFilter` method in instance of `InteractivityService`.

#### Using `ISelectionManager.registerOnSelectCallback`

When a user clicks on bookmarks, Power BI calls `callback` method of the visual with corresponding selections. 

```typescript
this.selectionManager.registerOnSelectCallback(
    (ids: ISelectionId[]) => {
        //called when a selection was set by Power BI
    });
);
```

Let's assume you have a data point in your visual created in [`'visualTransform'`](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-sampleBarChart/blob/master/src/barChart.ts#L74) method.

And `datapoints` looks like:

```typescript
visualDataPoints.push({
    category: categorical.categories[0].values[i],
    color: getCategoricalObjectValue<Fill>(categorical.categories[0], i, 'colorSelector', 'fill', defaultColor).solid.color,
    selectionId: host.createSelectionIdBuilder()
        .withCategory(categorical.categories[0], i)
        .createSelectionId(),
    selected: false
});
```

So, you have `visualDataPoints` as your data points and `ids` array passed to `callback` function.

At this point, the visual should compare the array of `ISelectionId[]` with the selections in your `visualDataPoints` array and mark corresponding data points as selected.

```typescript
this.selectionManager.registerOnSelectCallback(
    (ids: ISelectionId[]) => {
        visualDataPoints.forEach(dataPoint => {
            ids.forEach(bookmarkSelection => {
                if (bookmarkSelection.equals(dataPoint.selectionId)) {
                    dataPoint.selected = true;
                }
            });
        });
    });
);
```

After updating the data points, they'll reflect the current selection state stored in `filter` object. Then when the data points are rendered, the custom visual's selection state will match the state of the bookmark.

### Using `InteractivityService` for control selections in the visual

If your visual uses `InteractivityService`, you don't need any additional actions to support bookmarks in your visual.

The util will handle the visual's selection state when the user selects bookmarks.

### Visuals with filter

Let's assume that the visual creates a filter of data by date range. So, we have `startDate` and `endDate` as start and end of the range.
The visual creates an advanced filter and calls host method `applyJsonFilter` to filter data by the relevant conditions.
The `target` is the table for filtering.

```typescript
import { AdvancedFilter } from "powerbi-models";

const filter: IAdvancedFilter = new AdvancedFilter(
    target,
    "And",
    {
        operator: "GreaterThanOrEqual",
        value: startDate
            ? startDate.toJSON()
            : null
    },
    {
        operator: "LessThanOrEqual",
        value: endDate
            ? endDate.toJSON()
            : null
    });

this.host.applyJsonFilter(
    filter,
    "general",
    "filter",
    (startDate && endDate)
        ? FilterAction.merge
        : FilterAction.remove
);
```

Each time a user clicks a bookmark, the custom visual gets an `update` call.

The custom visual should check the filter in the object:

```typescript
const filter: IAdvancedFilter = FilterManager.restoreFilter(
    && options.jsonFilters
    && options.jsonFilters[0] as any
) as IAdvancedFilter;
```

If the `filter` object isn't null, the visual should restore filter conditions from the object:

```typescript
const jsonFilters: AdvancedFilter = this.options.jsonFilters as AdvancedFilter[];

if (jsonFilters
    && jsonFilters[0]
    && jsonFilters[0].conditions
    && jsonFilters[0].conditions[0]
    && jsonFilters[0].conditions[1]
) {
    const startDate: Date = new Date(`${jsonFilters[0].conditions[0].value}`);
    const endDate: Date = new Date(`${jsonFilters[0].conditions[1].value}`);

    // apply restored conditions
} else {
    // apply default settings
}
```

After that, the visual should change its internal state - data points and visualization objects (lines, rectangles, so on) - to reflect the current conditions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the report bookmarks scenario, the visual shouldn't call `applyJsonFilter` to filter other visuals - they will already be filtered by Power BI.

Timeline Slicer visual changes range selector to correspond data ranges.

### Filter state to save visual properties in bookmarks

The `filterState` property makes a property of a part of filtering. The visual can store different values in bookmarks.

To save the property value as filter state the object property should be marked as `"filterState": true` in `capabilities.json`.

Example: `Timeline Slicer` stores `Granularity` property values in filter. And it allows to change current granularity on changing of bookmarks by user.
