## What is the Power BI service?
The Microsoft Power BI service is sometimes referred to as Power BI online or app.powerbi.com. Power BI helps you stay up-to-date with the information that matters to you. With the Power BI service, *dashboards* help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business. Your dashboards display *tiles*, which you can select to open *reports* for exploring further. Connect to multiple *datasets* to bring all of the relevant data together in one place. Need help with understanding the building blocks that make up Power BI? See [Basic concepts for designers in the Power BI service](service-basic-concepts.md).

If you have important data in Excel or CSV files, you can create a Power BI dashboard to stay informed anywhere and share insights with others.  Do you have a subscription to a SaaS application like Salesforce?  Get a head start by connecting to Salesforce to automatically create a dashboard from that data, or [check out all the other SaaS apps](service-get-data.md) you can connect to. If you're part of an organization, see if any [apps](service-create-distribute-apps.md) have been published for you.

Read about all the other ways to [get data for Power BI](service-get-data.md).

## Step 1: Get data
Here's an example of getting data from a CSV file. Want to follow along with this tutorial? [Download the Financial Sample CSV file](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521962).

1. [Sign in to Power BI](http://www.powerbi.com/). Donâ€™t have an account? No worries, you can sign up for a free trial.
2. Power BI opens in your browser. Select **Get data** at the bottom of the left navigation bar.

    The **Get Data** page opens.   

3. Under the **Create new content** section, select **Files**. 
   
   ![Get files](media/service-get-started/gs1.png)
4.  Select **Local file**.
   
     ![Get Data > Files screen](media/service-get-started/gs2.png)

5. Browse to the file on your computer, and choose **Open**.

5. For this tutorial, we'll select **Import** to add the Excel file as a dataset, which we can then use to create reports and dashboards. If you select **Upload**, the entire Excel workbook is uploaded to Power BI, where you can open and edit it in Excel online.
   
   ![Choose Import](media/service-get-started/power-bi-import.png)
6. When your dataset is ready, select **View dataset** to open it in the report editor. 

    ![Your dataset is ready dialog](media/service-get-started/power-bi-gs.png)

    Because we haven't yet created any visualizations, the report canvas is blank.

    ![Blank report canvas](media/service-get-started/power-bi-report-editor.png)

7. Notice there's an option for **Reading view** on the top navigation bar. Because you have this option, that means you're currently in Editing view. 

    ![Reading view option](media/service-get-started/power-bi-editing-view.png)

    While in Editing view, you can create and modify your reports, because you're the *owner* of the report. That is, you're a *creator*. When you share your report with colleagues, they can only interact with the report in Reading view; your colleagues are *consumers*. Learn more about [Reading view and Editing view](consumer/end-user-reading-view.md).
    
    A great way to get familiar with the report editor is to [take a tour](service-the-report-editor-take-a-tour.md).
 

## Step 2: Start exploring your dataset
Now that you've connected to data, start exploring.  When you've found something interesting, you can create a dashboard to monitor it and see how it changes over time. Let's see how that works.
    
1. In the report editor, we'll use the **Fields** pane on the right side of the page to build a visualization. Select the  **Gross Sales** and **Date** checkboxes.
   
   ![Fields list](media/service-get-started/fields.png)

    Power BI analyzes the data and creates a visualization. If you selected **Date** first, you see a table. If you selected **Gross Sales** first, you see a chart. 

2. Switch to a different way of displaying your data. Let's see this data as a line chart. Select the line chart icon from the **Visualizations** pane.
   
   ![Report editor with line chart selected](media/service-get-started/gettingstart5new.png)

3. This chart looks interesting, so let's *pin* it to a dashboard. Hover over the visualization and select the pin icon. When you pin this visualization, it's stored on your dashboard and kept up-to-date so you can track the latest value at a glance.
   
   ![Pin icon](media/service-get-started/pinnew.png)

4. Because this report is new, you're prompted to save it before you can pin a visualization to a dashboard. Give your report a name (for example, *Sales over time*), and then select **Save and continue**. 
   
   ![Save report dialog](media/service-get-started/pbi_getstartsaveb4pinnew.png)
   
5. Pin the line chart to a new dashboard and name it *Financial sample for tutorial*. 
   
   ![Name the report](media/service-get-started/power-bi-pin.png)
   
6. Select **Pin**.
   
    A success message (near the top-right corner) lets you know the visualization was added as a tile to your dashboard.
   
    ![Pinned to dashboard dialog](media/service-get-started/power-bi-pin-success.png)

7. Select **Go to dashboard** to see the line chart that you pinned as a tile to your new dashboard. Make your dashboard even better by adding more visualization tiles and [renaming, resizing, linking, and repositioning your tiles](service-dashboard-edit-tile.md).
   
   ![Dashboard with visualization pinned](media/service-get-started/power-bi-new-dashboard.png)
   
8. Select the new tile on your dashboard to return to the report. Power BI returns you to the report editor in Reading view. To switch back to Editing view, select **Edit report** from the top navigation bar. After you're in Editing view, you can continue to explore and pin tiles. 

## Step 3:  Continue the exploration with Q&A (natural language querying)
1. For a quick exploration of your data, ask a question in the Q&A box. The Q&A question box is located at the top of your dashboard (**Ask a question about your data**) and in the top navigation bar in your report (**Ask a question**). For example, type *what segment had the most revenue* in the Q&A box.
   
   ![Q&A canvas](media/service-get-started/powerbi-qna.png)

2. Q&A searches for an answer and presents it in the form of a visualization. Select the pin icon ![Pin icon](media/service-get-started/pbi_pinicon.png) to show this visualization on your dashboard.
3. Pin the visualization to the **Financial Sample for tutorial** dashboard.
   
    ![Pin to dashboard dialog](media/service-get-started/power-bi-pin2.png)

4. Return to your dashboard, where you see the new tile.

   ![Dashboard with chart pinned](media/service-get-started/power-bi-final-dashboard.png)

## Clean up resources
Now that you've finished the tutorial, you can delete the dataset, report, and dashboard. 

1. In the left navigation bar, select **My Workspace**.
2. Select the **Datasets** tab and locate the dataset you imported for this tutorial.  
3. Select the ellipsis (...) > **Delete**.

    ![Delete the dataset](media/service-get-started/power-bi-delete.jpg)

    When you delete the dataset, Power BI also deletes the report and the dashboard.
